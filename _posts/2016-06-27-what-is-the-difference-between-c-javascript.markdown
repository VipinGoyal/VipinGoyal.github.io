title: What is the difference between C & Javascript 
layout: post
---
Hi, 

This is my first post, and I hope you'll like it going through.

I've worked in system side programming as well Javascript development. I found most code syntax is similar in both languages but there are so many difference between this two languages.

1) Flow of program
2) Javascript asynchronous behaviour
3) Scope difference between this two languages 
4) Memory management
